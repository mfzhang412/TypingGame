# TypingGame
This is an interactive game called "Fast Fingers" where users compete for the best score in typing. This game requires a server to run and stores the points of the top scorers, which can be viewed in-game. The faster the typing speed and the more accurate a user is, the higher the score he or she will earn.

This game requires NodeJS to run. One can open a nodeJS server from the game folder. To make the game publicly available, one can use Ngrok. Details on setting up the game can be found in the HOWTOPLAY.txt file.

This game was created by Michael Zhang and Aaron Maskarenas.

Aaron Maskarenas handled setting up the server. Michael Zhang handled the aesthetics and the interaction between pages. Both creators handled the coding.
