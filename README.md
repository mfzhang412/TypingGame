# TypingGame
This is an interactive game where users compete for the best score in typing. This game requires a server to run and stores the points of the top scorers, which can be viewed in-game. The faster the typing speed and the more accurate a user is, the higher the score he or she will earn.


This game was created by Michael Zhang and Aaron Maskarenas.

Aaron Maskarenas handled setting up the server. Michael Zhang handled the aesthetics and the interaction between pages. Both creators handled the coding.
