# TypingGame
This is an interactive game where users compete for the best score in typing. This game requires a server to run and stores the points of the top scorers, which can be viewed in-game. The faster the typing speed and the more accurate a user is, the higher the score he or she will earn.

This game was created by Michael Zhang and Aaron Maskarenas.
